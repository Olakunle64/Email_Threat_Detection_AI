    "This function **automatically labels emails as spam (1) or not spam (0)** based on predefined rules. It evaluates various **spam indicators** such as suspicious links, attachments, fake domains, and spam keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Key Spam Criteria  \n",
    "1️⃣ **Spam Score Threshold** – Emails with **more than 3 spam words** are flagged.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Excessive Links** – More than **5 links** could indicate phishing.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Suspicious Links** – Uses **shortened URLs or fake domains**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Too Many Attachments** – More than **4 attachments** suggests a potential scam.  \n",
    "5️⃣ **Dangerous File Types** – `.exe`, `.zip`, and similar files are often malware.  \n",
    "6️⃣ **HTML-Only Emails** – Emails **without plain text versions** could be phishing.  \n",
    "7️⃣ **Fake Sender Domains** – Identifies **spoofed sender email addresses**.  \n",
    "8️⃣ **Missing Recipient Info** – Spam emails **often lack a `To` field**.  \n",
    "9️⃣ **Bulk Emailing** – More than **5 recipients** suggests mass marketing or spam.  \n",
    "🔟 **Short Subject Lines** – Titles like `\"URGENT!\"` or `\"FREE!\"` can be spam signals.  \n",

    "### 🚀 Why This is Important?  \n",
    "- **Automates Spam Detection** – Provides a **baseline filtering method** before ML training.  \n",

    "## 🤖 Automating Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Overview  \n",
    "This pipeline **automates spam detection** by processing raw email text, extracting relevant features, and classifying emails using a **pre-trained machine learning model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Key Features  \n",
    "✔ **Feature Extraction** – Converts raw emails into structured features like **word count, number of links, HTML presence, suspicious domains, and attachments**.  \n",
    "✔ **Machine Learning Pipeline** – Uses `sklearn.Pipeline` to seamlessly **transform input data and classify it**.  \n",
    "✔ **Pre-Trained Model Integration** – Loads a **previously trained spam classifier** (`spam_classifier.pkl`) to make real-time predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 How It Works  \n",
    "1️⃣ **Extracts email metadata** (sender, recipient, subject, body, date).  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Computes security-related features** (spam score, suspicious links, fake domains).  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Feeds extracted features into the trained model** for prediction.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Classifies the email as spam (1) or not spam (0)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ Real-World Application  \n",
    "- **Detects phishing attempts** with scam links and fake domains.  \n",
    "- **Improves email security** by flagging high-risk emails.  \n",
    "- **Can be integrated into a web or API-based spam filter**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Next Step:** Deploy this pipeline in a **Flask API or UI** for real-time spam detection! 🚀  \n"
